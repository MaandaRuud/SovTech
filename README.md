6. The /search endpoint should accept query data as a query string
The above requirement has been ommited due to the approach used to query the API, (Hopefully this will not be seen as blatant disregard for instructions.)

The default url displays the results of the /chuck endpoint, and the other can be navigated to by the links. The SwaggerUi is also accessible via a link.

Thank you for the change and I am looking forward to joining the team so I can learn more.
